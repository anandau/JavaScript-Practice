            // O = Origin.
            // R = Resource.
            // S = Sharing.

            // now what is Origin here.
            // srk.com and github.com they both are origin domain names are origin.
            // now if we want to share data between two origin than you are not allowed to share tha data.
            // why !!!!.
            // what if you are at srk.com and you want data from bank.com ohhh nooo way.

            // in our case we want data from recipepuppy.com to our domain name.
            // so for that we have to talk to recipepuppy.com so that we can get the data.
            // now if recipepuppy.com wants to share data to any domain name than it has to implement the CORS Policy at the server side.
            // remember the CORS Policy can only be implemented at the server side.
            // so in our case the recipepuppy.com will implement -> ok the srk.com or whatever.com is allowed to aks for data and we can return it that is safe.
            // so basically to talk to recipepuppy.com we have to have an origin.
            // and if we look at the error
