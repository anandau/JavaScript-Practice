            // here if we get the data than we will get an error for CORS.
            // in this request we are block by the browser.
            // now what is CORS.
            // C = Cross.
            // O = Origin.
            // R = Resource.
            // S = Sharing.

            // now what is Origin here.
            // srk.com and github.com they both are origin domain names are origin.
            // now if we want to share data between two origin than you are not allowed to share tha data.
            // why !!!!.
            // what if you are at srk.com and you want data from bank.com ohhh nooo way.

            // in our case we want data from recipepuppy.com to our domain name.
            // so for that we have to talk to recipepuppy.com so that we can get the data.
            // now if recipepuppy.com wants to share data to any domain name than it has to implement the CORS Policy at the server side.
            // remember the CORS Policy can only be implemented at the server side.
            // so in our case the recipepuppy.com will implement -> ok the srk.com or whatever.com is allowed to aks for data and we can return it that is safe.
            // so basically to talk to recipepuppy.com we have to have an origin.
            // so we are running every files locally so cant talk to recipepuppy.com
            // so for that we have to run our files on server.
            // so we will use a server.
            // and here we will use the parcel.
            // we will install it in our server folder.

            // steps to install the parcel.

            // npm init.
            // npm i parcel-bundler
            // go to package.json
            // change "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
            // TO
            // "start": "parcel index.html"
            // create a new file in server index.html and copy our code.
            // and in terminal
            // npm run start
