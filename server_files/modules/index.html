    <!--modules :- being able to share code between multiple files.
    by using we can structure and organised code.

    created three different files handlers,utils,scripts and we want to share data between them.-->

    <!-- method 1
        in this method if we want to use returnHi from utils inside script.js than we have to load it before scripts.js

        // now what if, if you have 10000000 js files. ooookkkkk....
        // then we will load them.
        // ok got it you can write 10000000 scripts tags.

        // now what if, if 1000 files are dependent on another 1000 files how will you define their order.

        // oookkk now i give up. :).

        // then lets use Modules.

        <script src="utils.js"></script>
        <script src="scripts.js"></script>
     -->

    <!-- method 2
        if a CORS error occur then run code on server. because module does not work on local files.
    -->

    <script src="scripts.js" type="module"></script>
