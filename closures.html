    //2. calling the outer function creating a outer variable and returning the inner fun. thats why we are getting it into the variable.

    // even the outer fun is done but still we can access the outer value and maintain the outer variable.

    // now why would we ever use it.


    // example 2.

    console.log(sayHello("srk"));
    console.log(sayHi("srk"));

    // example 3. private variable.

    function game(name) {
        let score = 0;
        return function () {
            score++;
            return `your game name is ${name} and your score is ${score}`;
        }
    }

    const Game1 = game('cricket');
    const Game2 = game('football');
    //const Game2 = game();
    // here we cant access the score variable.
