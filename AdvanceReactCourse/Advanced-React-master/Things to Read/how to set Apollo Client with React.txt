=> Apollo allows us to communicate react with backend.
=> Apollo will do all data manager stuff as well as all other stuff
=> like fetching of the data from the server side, pushing of the data, Mutation, caching etc.

1. first open up frontend/lib/withData.js here we have defined our Apollo.
2. now go to _app.js and do stuff.
