# this file is public facing api this is where our react app will interfacing with.

# the type Mutation will help us to mutate the data in our prisma db.
# here we create our custom function to intreact with db.
# syntax:
# createItem(all the arument which we have given in our datamodel.prisma): return -> here we are returning all the items.
# here when we retrun anything then we have to create that returning part here as well.
# in this case it would be like this ->
# type Item { id: ID!, title: String!, description: String!, image: String, largeImage: String, price: Int!}
# so if we create Item here also then it is kind of repetive taks so what we is
# remember if the argument and the return value is same then we can import it from the prisma.graphql file.
# in our case the prisma.graphql has already create a type in prisma.graphql file so we just need to improt it from prisma.graphql.
# for importing we go something like this.

# import * from './generated/prisma.graphql'

# this is how we import everything from prisma.graphql.
# now below we are returning Item and we have not created Item type here also.
# so what it will do is it will go prisma.graphql and get the Item from it.

type Mutation {
    createItem(title: String, description: String!, price: Int!, image: String, largeImage: String): Item!
}

# the query will return our all the items.
type Query {
    items: [Item]!
}

# we will write our mutation and query code mutation.js and query.js
# after that run npm run dev if not running.
